Connect WordPress with External APIs and create no-code custom WordPress REST API endpoints to interact with the WordPress database to perform SQL operations.


== Description ==

[Connect to external APIs | Create Custom API in WP](https://plugins.miniorange.com/custom-api-for-wordpress) plugin formerly known as **Custom API for WP plugin** which helps you to _create no code custom REST endpoints/ Custom APIs_ into WordPress directly with an interactive **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** to fetch any type of data from any WordPress database tables like **users, posts, custom tables or any 3rd-party plugin's table**. You can also use HTTP request methods like **GET, POST, PUT, DELETE (Insert, Update, Delete)** data with these created Custom endpoint / Custom REST routes.

This plugin also helps you **connect to your external APIs** and platforms to **fetch the data and display via shortcode or template** as per your design (custom HTML, CSS and JS), post data on third-party platforms on any WordPress events (user creation, Woocommerce events, form submission, membership purchase etc) via WordPress hooks. 

This plugin has an interactive and simple UI that will allow you to interact with data by creating Custom REST API endpoints. It means you can easily interact with the WordPress database to perform **CRUD operations on data using the custom endpoints created (generated) using [Connect to external APIs | Custom endpoints for WP](https://plugins.miniorange.com/custom-api-for-wordpress)**.

[Connect to external APIs | Custom endpoints for WP](https://plugins.miniorange.com/custom-api-for-wordpress) takes care of writing the **complex SQL queries** to fetch/update data and provides you with a very simple User Interface to create or generate custom REST endpoints.
This plugin also provides the **filter operations in which you can filter the data** you want to show in the API endpoint response.

[Connect to external APIs | Custom endpoints for WP](https://plugins.miniorange.com/custom-api-for-wordpress) also adds a **layer of security by providing authentication methods**  to these custom-generated API endpoints. The authentication methods which are compatible with the plugin are: 
== ==
* [API Key Authentication](https://developers.miniorange.com/docs/rest-api-authentication/wordpress/api-key-authentication) 
* [JWT Authentication](https://developers.miniorange.com/docs/rest-api-authentication/wordpress/jwt-authentication)
* [Basic Authentication](https://developers.miniorange.com/docs/rest-api-authentication/wordpress/basic-authentication) 
* [OAuth 2.0 Authentication](https://developers.miniorange.com/docs/rest-api-authentication/wordpress/oauth-authentication)

You will also be able to **control the visibility** and customize the metadata attached to the Custom endpoint response. This plugin also **eliminates the risk of unauthorized access** to these custom endpoints that you created as it only gives access after successful user validation.


== Third-party/External API Integration into WordPress ==

* This plugin allows you to **integrate any external or third-party REST API endpoints into WordPress** very easily with the help of our interactive and simple GUI within seconds. With this function of our plugin, you can fetch data to your WordPress ([WooCommerce](https://woocommerce.com/)) site or you can use it to fetch data and process it according to your needs.

* These integrations can also be done on third-party plugin events like form submission using Elementor, [Wpforms](https://wpforms.com/), [Gravityforms](https://www.gravityforms.com/) etc. and also payment status or subscription status based on transactions done via payment gateways like that provided by [WooCommerce](https://woocommerce.com/), [Wpforms](https://wpforms.com/), [Gravityforms](https://www.gravityforms.com/) or any other services. 

* External API integrations can be done on any event of WordPress like user registration, user membership level change or any other using plugin hooks. 

* [WooCommerce](https://woocommerce.com/) product data can be synced with any external/third-party API provider(Supplier) on a real-time basis with our plugin. 

* This feature also provides the capability to register or login users to third-party platforms by making an API request to the third-party platforms. 

* **Data display on front end using shortcode or template tag** fetched from external API endpoints.

* Any kind of external APIs supporting **JSON**, **XML**, **SOAP**, **GraphQL** can be connected with authentication methods like **OAuth**, **JWT**, **Bearer**, **API Key** or even **custom API authentication**.

== Use Cases ==

* Access custom data of the WordPress site into your mobile application or web clients via custom REST API Endpoints.
* Create easy **Custom REST Routes to Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD)** WordPress content from client-side JavaScript or external applications.
* **Interact with any standard database** schema/ table or your custom-built schema/ table to fetch/ update/ delete data using the custom API endpoints.
* **Connect two WordPress sites** or connect your WordPress site with a website built in any framework and Get/Update/Insert/Delete (CRUD) data of one website to another website with the help of Custom API and feasibility of connection with External APIs / Custom Endpoints developed in the external Website.
* **Connect with External Rest API Routes to display data on your website** or process the data received from External Endpoint.
* **[Integrate External/third-party REST API endpoints with third-party plugin's payment gateways](https://plugins.miniorange.com/integrate-external-third-party-rest-api-endpoints-into-wordpress)** like that of [WooCommerce](https://woocommerce.com/), [Wpforms](https://wpforms.com/)or any other custom gateway such that the API can be called automatically based on the payment status.
* **Integrate External/ third-party REST API endpoints with custom/ third-party plugins' forms** like that of [Wpforms](https://wpforms.com/), Elementor, [Gravityforms](https://www.gravityforms.com/) etc such that the external APIs can be called on these forms submission or any related events to perform fetch/update/delete operation based on API endpoints.
* **Sync third-party/external API provider's (Supplier's) API Inventory data into [WooCommerce](https://woocommerce.com/)** and display them in the product feed on a real-time basis. [[More detials]](https://plugins.miniorange.com/woocommerce-api-product-sync-with-woocommerce-rest-apis)
* **Integrate external APIs into WooCommerce** - If you have a Woocommerce store and want to update the data like order creation, order status, and user profile update on a third-party platform in real-time, then a solution can be provided using our plugin.
* **Data display using shortcode** - Fetch data from external API with security and display that on WordPress front-end pages using the shortcodes with customized design.
